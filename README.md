# Vietcong-scripts
Database of reconstructed and original script codes of the Vietcong game

I will upload as I reconstruct more code. For now there is just the CTF4x4 script which has been modified so it could be run both normally (New custom map and gamemode - client downloads it and plays on your server)
or it can be run using script sideloading and cbf patching on a vanilla map so the client does not need to download anything. I will release the tools for that later.
Bots now spawn correctly in waves with players and they dynamically "disconnect" as human players log in. It should also log killstreaks and other things, but that only works when the server and client have the same script. I did not test that function so it may or may not work however it does not disrupt the scripts function so i left it there.
